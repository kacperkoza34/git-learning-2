                        <p>I hear the drums echoing tonight
                          But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
                          She's coming in, 12:30 flight
                          The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
                          I stopped an old man along the way
                          Hoping to find some old forgotten words or ancient melodies
                          He turned to me as if to say, "Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you"
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
                          There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
                          I bless the rains down in Africa
                          Gonna take some time to do the things we never had (ooh, ooh)
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                          The wild dogs cry out in the night
                          As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company
                          I know that I must do what's right
                          As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
                          I seek to cure what's deep inside, frightened of this thing that I've become
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
